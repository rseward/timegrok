- a time string interpreter module

## Summary

Python Module for interpreting human time expressions.

This module can interpret time strings such as:

- in 10 minutes
- in five minutes
- in twenty five minutes

Or in precise date expressions such as:

- next monday
- last tuesday
- in 7 days
- month end

My motivation for this module is for a personal voice assistant with reminder skills similar to Alexa.
